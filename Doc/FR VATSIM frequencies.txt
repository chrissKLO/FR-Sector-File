As a general rule, the frequencies in use for VATSIM ATC positions match those published for the real world.

However, sometimes the frequency published for VATSIM needs to be different. This is usually due one of the following:

- VOR frequencies used for ATIS (which are impossible to use with current pilot clients)
- 8.33kHz-spaced frequencies, which can't be selected in FS/pilot client

The following is a list of published FR VATSIM frequencies that differ from their real-world counterpart:
